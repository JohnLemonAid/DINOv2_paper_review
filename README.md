# DINOv2_paper_review
In this project, I review and analyze the tools and aspects of the algorithms and methods used in the paper -DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193). Further mathematical analysis of the loss functions that appeared in the paper was conducted outside of the scope for this project, and thus was excluded.
